**To Do Bot:**

This bot allows our users to have a friend that helps them organize their tasks. We allow our users to:

_1) Add a task_\
        - "remind me to sleep at 10:00 pm" this task gets assigned a taskID which the user is informed of and can double check at any time by typing view\
_2) Delete a task_\
        - "delete 1" of the format keyword delete followed by taskID\
_3) Edit existing tasks_\
        - edit a task by typing "edit task_ID : new_task task_time" for example "edit 1: remind me to sleep at 9 pm"\
_4) Check all completed tasks_\
        - type "completed"\
_5) View all tasks_\
        - type "view" to view all tasks\
_6) Ask for help with commands_\
        - type "help" for assistance with commands\

We hope to make the lives of our users easier with the convenience of our very own toDoBot!
