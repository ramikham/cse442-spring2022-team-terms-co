# **About**
TaskBot is a Discord bot that can be used to schedule daily tasks. TaskBot offers many functionalities to help in tasks scheduling. Whenever you schedule a task, TaskBot
will associate a task_ID with that task. You can retrieve the task_ID of the tasks you scheduled by typing *view*. Knowing the task_ID will help you do many things with 
your tasks, like deleting or editing them.
