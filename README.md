To Do Bot:

This bot allows our users to have a friend that helps them organize their tasks. We allow our users to:

1) Add a task
    -> "remind me to sleep at 10 pm"
   this task gets assigned a taskID which the user is informed of and can double check at any time by typing view
3) Delete a task
    -> "delete 1" of the format keyword delete followed by taskID
5) Edit existing tasks
    -> edit a task by typing "edit task_ID : new_task task_time" for example "edit 1: remind me to sleep at 9 pm"
7) Check all completed tasks
    -> type "completed"
9) View all tasks
     -> type "view" to view all tasks
11) Ask for help with commands
     -> type "help" for assistance with commands

We hope to make the lives of our users easier with the convenience of our very own toDoBot!
